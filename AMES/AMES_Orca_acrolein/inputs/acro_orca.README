Dear student,
Here is the homework for the AES classes on multiconfigurational quantum chemistry. Follow the instructions on the "acro-orca.pdf" file. Calculations are tested with orca 4, but should also run without problems with orca 3. If you encounter a problem with generating the molden file, you can find it among the files that are in this zip-file. If you dont have acces to orca please contact me (coen.degraaf@urv.cat). Make a short report of your findings (not longer than two pages, please) and send it (preferably) as pdf to me.

All the best,
Coen de Graaf
